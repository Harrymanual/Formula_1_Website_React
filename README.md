# Design choice

Hello, how are you doing. 
So basically here is where I am at. I want to make the driver and team pages scrape data from the official formula 1 website and refresh everytime I update the page. Make my own API if you will and communicate with a server running python. The biggest issue is that I am dirt poor and dont want to pay 7 dollars a month for the sake of hoowing real time formula 1 data on my website because it literally doesnt matter. So instead of doing it all via copy and paste im gonna make a python script and whack it somewhere in this repo. This python script will scrape the data from the website, smack it into a text file and then my javascript is going to steal the information from that text file and input it into the html I hope. To tie it all together I would like to make a bash script that somehow i just run and it runs the python file and then makes the javascript update??? i dont really know but thats a future me problem. 

Other design choices include the white colour behind the driver cards, in an ideal world these would be transparent png files however that make the file size significantly larger and I only have 512 mb of space on this server, so every mb counts considering its over 7 times larger in some cases. This makes it look kinda weird when you hover over the images as the background doesnt change with the image as I intended.
